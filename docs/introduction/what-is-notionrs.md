# What is notionrs?

notionrs is the API client of [Notion HTTP API](https://developers.notion.com/).

Notion's API responses can be complex, and while you can manually handle serialization and deserialization, it can be time-consuming. This crate was created to simplify interacting with the Notion API, providing an easier way to make API calls.
