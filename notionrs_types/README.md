# notionrs_types â€” Just a Schema Definition Crate

Notion API schemas may occasionally introduce new fields.
Updating the main crate (`notionrs`) every time leads to breaking changes due to Rustâ€™s strict type system.
To mitigate this, all schema definitions are extracted into this separate crate.

This crate contains only the data structures shared across the `notionrs` ecosystem.
