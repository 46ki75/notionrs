Below is a basic example. (More detailed documentation is coming soon, so please stay tuned!)

```rs
use notionrs::{
    block::{Block, ParagraphBlock},
    error::Error,
    Client, RichText,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    dotenvy::dotenv().ok();

    let client = Client::new();

    // Here, we're retrieving the ID from an environment variable,
    // but you can change the method of retrieval to suit your needs.
    let block_id = std::env::var("NOTION_PAGE_ID").unwrap();

    let block = Block::Paragraph {
        paragraph: ParagraphBlock::new()
            .rich_text(vec![RichText::from("Time to start with Notion in Rust")]),
    };

    let request = client
        .append_block_children()
        .block_id(block_id.clone())
        .children(vec![block]);

    let response = request.send().await?;

    println!("{:?}", response);

    Ok(())
}
```
